The user needs to create an account in the New York Times developer portal and generate user-specific API keys to authenticate API calls. Few high rated features as following.

1. Book reviews service returns NYT book review by the author, ISBN, or title. Book API provides information about the book reviews and bestsellers lists.

The purpose of this application is to provide one platform to address frequently asked questions about NYT articles, best-ranked movies, and books. Usually, people would like to know the most-read books, their reviews. This application will help them find answers to important questions. Similarly, the same user can find similar details about movies, articles, and books to satisfy its need and at the same time keep the interest growing in reading and watching the best items in different genres.

## Motivation:

I like to watch movies, read books, and read the latest articles related to celebrities and based on Nobel laureate. Therefore, I have chosen the NYT API to analyze as my project data source. I feel that it will be great to see the most-read books, watched movies, and find the highest-ranked articles at the same time on one page.
