Boiler Room===>Giovanni Ribisi portrays a young stockbroker in training at a fly-by-night company called J. T. Marlin. Like Oliver Stone's &quot;Wall Street,&quot; &quot;Boiler Room&quot; tells the story of an ambitious young man's rise, fall and redemption. And like Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox, Mr. Ribisi's Seth carries some heavy Oedipal baggage &#151; a troubled relationship with his demanding, disapproving father &#151; onto the trading floor. But at its best, which is awfully good, &quot;Boiler Room&quot; avoids the thumping moralism that has made Mr. Stone the least misunderstood director in Hollywood. It's less about selling your soul than about feeling your oats. &#151; A. O. Scott===>2017-11-02 04:17:58===>A. O. Scott

Collateral===>In &quot;Collateral,&quot; the edgy new thriller from the director Michael Mann, the city never sleeps, it doesn't even relax. Set in Los Angeles mostly after dark, after the city's sunshine has given way to cool noir, the story centers on a taxi driver, Max (Jamie Foxx), and the assassin, Vincent (Tom Cruise), who hops a ride with him deep into the night. Pitched between interludes of anxious intimacy and equally nerve-shredding set pieces, &quot;Collateral&quot; scores its points with underhand precision. The film is about a lot of different things, about how Los Angeles lights up even at night, how cars become prostheses of our selves and how driving with the radio on can be bliss. But as with all of Mr. Mann's movies, &quot;Collateral&quot; is finally about men and work, and about how being a man is itself a kind of job, which explains why this fastidiously crafted commercial film isn't just an entertainment, but a statement of personal faith. — Manohla Dargis===>2017-11-02 04:18:04===>Manohla Dargis
The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement===>In the cardboard kingdom of Genovia, the setting for the new feature-length fairy tale &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement,&quot; the streets are as scrubbed of dirt and personality as a Disney theme park. A mythic European country where everyone speaks accented English by way of Britain, France and Brooklyn, Genovia is the adopted home of Princess Mia (Anne Hathaway), a one-time San Francisco teenager-turned-old-world pretender. Unlike Pinocchio, Mia doesn't hang her wish on just any star; she hangs it on the movie-made promise that every girl can find her inner princess and, like, you know, rule. Directed by Garry Marshall, who's been selling wish-fulfillment fantasies for years, most notably in &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; and written by Shonda Rhimes, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2&quot; combines a classic storybook scenario, in which the former ugly duckling refines her swan standing, with the usual self-help uplift. This time around, the princess who would be queen learns what the rest of us know already: happy movie endings generally come to those women who eat their independence and, in time, a wedding cake too. — Manohla Dargis===>2017-11-02 04:18:04===>Manohla Dargis
Exorcist: The Beginning===>Spinning heads, cascades of pea soup and your mother's Army boots are nowhere to be found in &quot;Exorcist: The Beginning,&quot; but lovers of the ridiculous may be delighted to know that the specter of little Linda Blair a-twitch and a-tremble is not entirely forgotten. A prequel to &quot;The Exorcist,&quot; William Friedkin's 1973 shocker in which Ms. Blair played a child hijacked by Beelzebub, this new film comes gussied up with some fine talent (it stars Stellan Skarsgard as the same character played by Max von Sydow in the original) and a bag of cheap tricks, but when push comes to demonic shove hell apparently hath no fury like a woman in green pancake makeup just as surely as some producers hath no shame. Despite Renny Harlin's reliance on shock cuts and loud noises, however, the film singularly fails to deliver any palpable shivers. Perhaps more expectedly it does afford the occasional and presumably unintended laugh. — Minhola Dargis===>2017-11-02 04:18:04===>Manohla Dargis
Suspect Zero===>Finally, a serial killer movie so preposterous, so garnished with accidental laugh lines and absent essential narrative logic it may actually put a permanent kibosh on this tediously overworked crime subgenre. Here's hoping, at any rate. Directed with self-conscious hothouse flair by E. Elias Merhige, from a puzzler of a screenplay credited to Zak Penn and Billy Ray, &quot;Suspect Zero&quot; involves a serial killer who's doing away with other serial killers and the disgraced F.B.I. agent who refuses to let this meta-murder madness go unpunished. Think &quot;Seven&quot; minus the talent. Soon after the agent Thomas Mackelway (Aaron Eckhart) lands in the F.B.I.'s Albuquerque bureau, he discovers a man's mutilated body carefully arranged amid the cacti and sand. One thing leads to another leads to a halfway house where twitchy Benjamin O'Ryan (Ben Kingsley) scratches out the kind of eerily beautiful artwork so beloved of movie sociopaths. As Mackelway tracks O'Ryan, it soon appears that the hunter and the hunted may be on the same horrific page even if the director and the screenwriters are not. — Manohla Dargis===>2017-11-02 04:18:04===>Manohla Dargis
Hero===>In Zhang Yimou's &quot;Hero,&quot; an ambitious period epic about the birth of the first Chinese empire, warriors fly through the air like birds of prey, their swords cutting through enemies and lovers alike. Set during the third century B.C., the story of an assassination plot unfolds with such dazzling bursts of color and blurs of furious action it might be easy to miss the nationalistic message tucked amid the visual enchantments. The martial-arts film star Jet Li is the title's nameless warrior who claims to have vanquished the kings most feared enemies, Sky (Donnie Yen), Snow (Maggie Cheung Man Yuk) and the powerful Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). In time, Nameless spins a second, a third and finally a fourth version, changes in perspective that Mr. Zhang signals with shifts of color that flood the screen with a red as vivid as that of a Little Red Book, a spotless white, a delicate blue and a pale pistachio so mouthwatering you may want to lick the screen. Roll over Chairman Mao and tell the comrades the news: the history of the empire now comes wrapped in kaleidoscopic kung fu cool. — Manohla Dargis===>2017-11-02 04:18:04===>Manohla Dargis
